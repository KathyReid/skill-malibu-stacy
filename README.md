# skill-malibu-stacey

This Skill is an homage to all the women who grew up knowing that Malibu Stacy was a vacuous, vapid waste of plastic, and that they were better off spending their time learning iterators, linked lists and relational algebra than baking cookies for boys, or shopping.

Let Mycroft help you when you need that extra element of sarcasm when dealing with the mansplainer in your life.
